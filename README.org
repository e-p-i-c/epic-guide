Welcome to the *Engineering Project Intelligence Coordination* system!

The *EPIC* system is designed to provide a platform and set of tools 
to aid in the collective coordination of information relating to
the process of accomplishing engineering tasks.

TLDR; Yet Another Project Management Tool

What EPIC aims to do different:

- Documentation-first approach
   - Embodies literate programming concept
   - Documentation and code co-exist
   - Documentation drives specification

- STITS development
   - Specification instructs testing
   - Testing drives implementation
   - Implementation confirms testing
   - Testing confirms specification
   - Specification confirms documentation
